The reason why there are not good backtest is because the magnitude of the price when the model is correct it not enough to match or be better than the magnitude when the model is wrong


CREATE A MODEL THAT CAN PREDICT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE MOVE

If the market conditions indicate a strong upward trend and the model consistently predicts 1, the simulator will maintain a long position throughout this period.
When the prediction eventually flips to -1 (suggesting a downward trend), it will switch to a short position, trying to capitalize on the expected decrease in price.


DO NOT NEED TO CHNAGE THE LOT SIZE IN LIVE MARKETS FOR JPY PAIRS AS:
JPY pairs are quoted with two decimal places compared to four for most other pairs. This difference affects how you calculate pip values:
For most currency pairs: A pip is typically the fourth decimal place (0.0001).
For JPY pairs: A pip is at the second decimal place (0.01).


Yes, your interpretation is correct. The code structure you've described for the simulate_trading function in the ForexTradingSimulator class is designed to manage trading positions based on the direction indicated by the Predicted value. It strategically opens and closes positions to align with these predictions, ensuring that the trading position matches the latest forecast until a change in direction is predicted. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how this logic works:

Trading Logic Breakdown
Check Predicted Movement:
If Predicted is 1, this suggests the expectation of a price increase.
If Predicted is -1, this indicates the expectation of a price decrease.
Position Management:
For each row in your DataFrame (which presumably represents a new time step with a new prediction):
If the prediction is for a price increase (Predicted == 1):
If there is no open position (not self.is_open_position), or if the current position is short (self.position == 'short'), then:
If a position is already open and it’s a short position, it first closes this position to realize any gains or losses.
Then it opens a new long position.
If the prediction is for a price decrease (Predicted == -1):
If there is no open position, or if the current position is long, then:
If a position is already open and it’s a long position, it closes this position.
Then it opens a new short position.
Practical Implications
Staying in Position: If Predicted remains constant (e.g., it is always 1 or always -1), and a position has been opened that aligns with this prediction (e.g., long for 1 and short for -1), the simulator will not close or reopen positions needlessly. It will stay in the current position until the predicted direction changes. This is efficient as it minimizes transaction costs and potential slippage.
Responsive to Changes: When Predicted changes from 1 to -1 or vice versa, the simulator reacts by closing the current position (if any) and opening a new one in the opposite direction. This ensures that the trading strategy is always aligned with the latest prediction.
Transaction Costs and Market Impact: By avoiding unnecessary closes and reopens when the predicted movement doesn't change, the strategy helps conserve capital by reducing transaction costs and potentially adverse market impacts due to frequent trading.
Example
If the market conditions indicate a strong upward trend and the model consistently predicts 1, the simulator will maintain a long position throughout this period.
When the prediction eventually flips to -1 (suggesting a downward trend), it will switch to a short position, trying to capitalize on the expected decrease in price.
This logic ensures that your trading strategy dynamically adapts to new data while remaining efficient by not reacting to every single new data point unless it signifies a change in market conditions.
